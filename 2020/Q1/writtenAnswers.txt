Q1.b:
 i.   - A command if a method call that tells an object to do something (delegates all of the work to that class),
    whereas a query will ask something of the object (requesting information).
 ii.  - getNumberOfPendingOrders() is a query, order() is a command.
 iii. - designing code based on commands makes collaborating objects less dependant on each other. The client calls the method
    order() and expects everything to be fully dealt with by the OrderProcessor.
 iv.  - "Tell, don't ask"
