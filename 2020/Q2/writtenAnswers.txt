Q2.a: - StockMarketDataFeed uses a singleton design pattern. This is queried in line 25 of AlgoTrader inside trade().
    It's hard to unit test AlgoTrader as it draws all of its pricing information from this singleton class making it
    non-deterministic.

   b.i:  - we can use an adapter pattern to isolate the two packages.
    .ii: - This relates to the Hexagonal Architectural Style.

   c. - for dependency inversion we probably want to make AlgoTrader independent from SimpleBroker. We can do this by abstracting
    SimpleBroker out to an interface.
