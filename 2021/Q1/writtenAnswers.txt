Q1.c:
    i.  - Singleton. You can easily tell this by noticing references to "instance" everywhere.
    ii. - It's hard to test singleton classes and their collaborators. Since there's only one instance, which is
    accessible to many different objects, we can get non-deterministic behaviour ie. two collaborators can change the
    instance's data so we can't be sure what state it's in at any given time.
