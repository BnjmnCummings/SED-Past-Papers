Question 1:
a.i: The First source of coupling is the use of LocalTime
a.ii: The second source of Coupling is the BillingSystem class.
a.iii: If either the BillingSystem or LocalTime classes are changed/deprecated,
    our PhoneCall class could need changes or become redundant.

Question 2:
a.i: - One benefit of using MVC is modularity. We've seperated the code maintaining the program's data (model) from the
    code governing the GUI display (view). This makes our application easier to test and maintain as functionality is
    clearly compartmentalised. (This also makes the Model class more mobile).

a.ii: - Another benefit is Scalability. We can easily change the Model to use an observer pattern, registering many views
    as observers. This allows us to have many different displays and decouples Model from View (if we have view
    implement an updatable/observer interface).

a.iii - An alternative to MVC is PAC (Presentation Abstraction-Control).
